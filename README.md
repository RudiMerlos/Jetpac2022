# JETPAC 2022

Jetpac 2022 is a remake of Jetpac Spectrum 48k version. It has been developed in java and libGDX.

## HISTORY AND INSTRUCTIONS

The 'Acme Interstellar Transport Company' is delivering spaceship kits to various planets in the solar system throughout the Galaxy and as chief test pilot, all you have to do is assemble the Rockets, and thrust on to your next destination.

As you don't often get the chance of a free trip across the Galaxy, this is a great opportunity to get rich! Stop off on several planets on your journey, collect the odd sack of precious gems, elements or gold, and take them back with you.

Sounds simple doesn't it!

But before you make yourself the richest person in the whole Universe, remember to refuel your Spaceship - with 6 fuel pods - every time you land on a planet. Any other goodies you collect are yours to keep.  Upon landing, you will find yourself equipped with the very latest Hydrovac Jet Pac, which can automatically air lift almost any rocket stage, fuel pod or valuables that you care to land upon, and release them over the rocket ship base. Don't forget your mega- powerful, Quad Photon Laser Phasers can blast any nasty, mean aliens who might object to your visit.

## CONTROLS

You can control your player by using either a Joystick (only Xbox 360 controller compatible models work) or the keyboard.
